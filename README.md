# Reinforcement Learning Project : Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences  
## Authors : Abdellahi ELEMINE VALL, Thomas FLOURENT, Yannis MOUDERE   


With regard to the difficulty to set up an environnment where actual humans spend minutes elicitating their preferences, we considered that the reward function was actually known. We implemented the 'Interaction with the Environment' step of the algorithm presented in the paper.  

In this configuration, we aim at optimizing the policy using the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) method, presented in the summary.  

The game in which we tested our algorithm is the CartPole from the Classic Control.
